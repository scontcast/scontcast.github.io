<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm licensed in Pharmaceutial Sciences from the University of Chile, (Santiago, Chile). My undergraduate thesis was performed at Luis Qui√±ones lab in the field of Pharmacogenomics where I studied the association of various single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) with the metabolization of cyclosporine in kidney transplanted patients (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.674117/full">Article</a>). </p>

<p>After finishing my license and professional degree of Pharmaceutical Chemist, I was awarded with a scholarship from the Chilean Government (CONICYT) to perform a PhD in Rebecca Oakey's lab at King's College London (London, UK). During my PhD I studied the effect of hydroxyurea on DNA methylation and gene expression in myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients and mouse model (<a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2021/07/23/gr.270066.120">Article</a>).</p>

<p>Currently, I'm a postdoc in Catherine Sawai lab (INSERM U1312) at the University of Bordeaux (Bordeaux, France). Here I study the effect of aging in normal hematopoiesis using a transgenic mouse model (Sawai, et al 2015) that allows to do lineage tracing.
